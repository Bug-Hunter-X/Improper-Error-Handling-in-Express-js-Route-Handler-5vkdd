# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database but lacks robust error handling.  This can lead to application crashes or the exposure of sensitive information if exceptions are not caught and handled gracefully.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates best practices for handling errors, providing informative error responses to clients, and logging errors for debugging.
